Theory without practical application does not benefit a performer. From theory, technique, language and repertoire should be developed.

Harmony
-------

Harmony is a collection of pitches that form a group. The pitch collection is derived from the tuning system employed that attempts to approximate the harmonic series (12TET is most common; others have various trade-offs). The distance between two pitches is an interval. Within an octave, intervals are either 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths or 7ths. 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths may be either major or minor. 4ths and 5ths may be either perfect, augmented or diminished. The inversion of an interval will add to nine, major will invert to minor, augmented will invert to diminished, and perfect will invert to perfect. That is a perfect 4th will invert to a perfect 5th, a minor 2nd will invert to a major 7th, and an augmented 4th will invert to a diminished 5th. A cycle exists in 12TET using either the perfect 4th or 5th, where all 12 notes of the chromatic scale will be produced.

A diatonic scale is a collection of seven pitches derived from the harmonic series that produces a collection of chords/chordscales/modes. One method for deriving the major scale is to stack perfect 5ths. Scales are constructed with major and minor (and augmented) second intervals, chords are constructed with a combination of major and minor thirds.

Triads are three pitches separated by thirds:

* Augmented: major third below major third
* Major: major third below minor third
* Minor: minor third below major third
* Diminished: minor third below minor third

The five qualities are seventh chords that appear frequently (may be extended and altered):

* Major: major third below minor third below major third
* Dominant: major third below minor third below minor third
* Minor: minor third below major third below minor third
* Half-Diminished: minor third below major third below minor third
* Dimished: minor third below minor third below minor third

The only differentiation between major dominant and minor is within the 3rd and 7th of each chord, the guide tones. For instance, for the C family of chords (chords whose root is C) only the E and B are relevant to determining the quality provided the root (the 5th may be omitted):

* Major - C-E-G-B
* Dominant - C-E-G-Bb
* Minor - C-Eb-G-Bb

Three sets of scales can form the five qualities, extensions, and altered chords (there are other scales):

* Major
* Melodic minor
* Harmonic minor

From those scales, chordscales/modes for each of the five qualities (listing not exhaustive):

* Major 7th:
    - Major: Ionian 1st mode, Lydian #11 4th mode
    - Melodic Minor: 3rd mode #5
* Dominant:
    - Major: Mixolydian
    - Melodic Minor: Lydian Dominant #11, Aeolian Dominant b13, Superlocrian/Altered (fourth is treated as a third, second and third are treated as b9 and #9, fifth and sixth are treated as b5 and #5).
    - Harmonic Minor: 5th mode b9b13
* Minor:
    - Major: Dorian 2nd mode, Phrygian 3rd mode, Aeolian 6th mode
    - Melodic Minor: Minor Major 1st mode
    - Harmonic Minor: Minor Major 1st mode
* Half-Diminished:
    - Major: Locrian 7th mode
* Diminished:
    - Harmonic Minor: 7th mode

Polychords/upper structures are two or more chords stacked on top of one other. This is a common technique on altered dominants, some examples:

* C7#11 -> D/C7
* C7b13 -> C+/C7
* C7b9b13 -> Db-/C7
* C7b9b5 -> Gb/C7
* C7#9b5 -> Eb-/C7
* C7#9#5 -> Ab/C7

Functional harmony assigns a function to each of the seven scale degrees within the Major scale:

* Sub-Dominant (or Pre-Dominant) - ii, VI
* Dominant - V, vii
* Tonic - I, iii, vi

The most common progression ii-V-I proceeds from sub-dominant to dominant to tonic. This progression is analogous to a story where each function follows a simplified plot arc: sub-dominant (exposition), dominant (conflict), tonic (resolution).

Chords may progress by root movement circularly, chromatically or diatonically.

ii-V-I is an example of circle movement. Backcycling allows this pattern to be extended backwards from the target chord, for instance vii-iii-vi-ii-V-I.

ii-bII-I is an example of chromatic movement. Tri-tone substitution is where the guide tones of the V or swapped for the guide tones of the bII, for instance G7 and Db7 share B(Cb) and F guide tones. Since tri-tone substution creates chromatic motion from cycle motion, chromatic and cycle movement are equivalent. VI-iii-bii-ii-V-I is the tri-tone substituted progression of vii-iii-vi-ii-V-I.

Diatonic motion occurs when the root movement of the chord progression is within the key, but not cycle motion. An example would be I-vi-ii-V, where I-vi is an example of function substitution (I and vi both being tonic).

Often chords are substituted with secondary dominants, for instance I-VI-ii-V where vi is substituted with VI7. VI7 tonicizes the ii chord. Another common secondary dominant is III7, which tonicizes the vi; vi is the relative minor of the major scale. III7 often uses b9 and/or b13 as alterations (borrowed from 5th mode harmonic minor), vii-III-vi is the minor equivalent of ii-V-I.

Modal interchange is another chord-borrowing technique; the most common borrowing occurs between parallel and relative major and minor keys. For instance, the back-door dominant bVII-I progression borrows the V from the parallel minor key. That is, the Bb7 in Bb7-C is borrowed from Eb major/C minor.

Non-functional harmony relies on voice-leading to construct chord progressions that do not need to be related by keys.

Rhythm
------

Time composed of tempo, time signatures, measures/bars, subdivisions/grid, and feel.

Tempo is the pulse or beat. Time signatures denote how many beats per measure and the unit measure assigned to the beat (typically quarter note). Subdivisions are how measures and beats are divided: whole/half/quarter/eighth/sixteenth, tuplets, dotted. Feel refers to how time is perceived: swing/straight, rubato, ahead/behind/on-top, pocket, backbeat.

_Harmony and rhythm are the same, an order of magnitude apart. That is, an octave is is a 2:1 beat, a perfect five is a 3:2 beat. An A above middle C is 440hz, and is equivalent to a beat with a tempo of 440*60 BPM._

Melody
------

A linear musical statement defines (and is constrained by) a harmonic and rhythmic context. Melody is the intersection of rhythm and harmony. Melodic phrases outline the harmony or superimpose new harmony on top of the existing chord structures. Melodic phrases also re-inforce the rhythmic context: time, feel, accents. Of the two, rhythm is more crucial than harmony in facilitating entrainment. It is better to play the wrong note at the right time, than the right note at the wrong time.

Language is melodic statements that can be developed either by: developing theory into an exercise or developing a melodic line from a recording into an excercise.
