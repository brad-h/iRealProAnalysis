iRealProAnalysis
================

Doing some analysis of different tracks in the [Jazz 1350](https://www.irealb.com/forums/showthread.php?12753-Jazz-1350-Standards) playlist using the [pyRealParser](https://github.com/drs251/pyRealParser) library.

Questions
---------

* What are the most common keys?
* What is the breakdown between songs in major vs minor keys?
* What chords are most prevalent?
* What chord progressions are most prevalent?
* What contrafacts exist in this dataset?
* What other datasets can be extracted by crawling the iReal forums?

TODO
----

* Convert chords to roman numeral notation to allow analysis between charts that share similar progressions in different keys
* Do Markov Chain analysis of chord progressions
* Find a way to represent related chords to highlight their similarites (e.g. quality)
